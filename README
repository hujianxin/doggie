Pybase is a library for Python to interact with HBase Shell
=================================================

In many cases, developer can not play with HBase thrift server, they can just use hbase in `hbase shell way`. If you are one of them, `pybase` is for you.

WIP, but some useful function has been completed. If the current status of `pybase` does not meet your renewal, Pull Request is welcomed, thanks!
